        <div>
            <p>Like a lot of kids i got into computers from playing video games but i knew i was never going to be a pro gamer so i looked into something more relistic 
                and after watching tons of interesting youtubers I knew that coding was what I wanted to do.</p>
            <p><br>I started off by applying for a certificate III in Information and Digital Technology at my school. I worked in the IT department 1 day every week and had to complete moduals over 2 years to complete the certificiate.
            All though only one of the moduals focused on codeing, it showed me the basics of whats out there in the computer world.</p>

            <p>At the end of the Certificate i recieved an award from busy at work for being one of the best trainees from our school. I also entered into a Australian wide competion to find the best trainee. 
                I was selected within the top 5 of my region with only 3 able to go to the next round, i didn't make it past the phone interview by a couple points. Even though I wasn't selected it was a great experiences to express myself.</p>

            <p>Conways game of life was the hardest and most fun coding project i've done, it was coded in C#. Adition features were added to the game of life to make the coding more chanlenging, it gave me a lot of problem solving experiences.</p>
